# My-Todo-App
My first web development project. The tool stack used here was HTML, CSS and JS for front end, Flask (Python) for backend and SQLite as the database.
This is a simple todo app in which you can feed in the tasks which you want to do and update or delete them as per requirements.
The website has been hosted on Heroku.
